The terraform directory in the InfrastructureAsCode folder of the devops-bootcamp repository contains Terraform code for deploying infrastructure resources to Microsoft Azure cloud platform. Here's a brief description of each resource that gets deployed:

Resource Group: A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed to Azure. It helps to organize resources and to manage their lifecycle collectively.

Virtual Network: A virtual network (VNet) is a logically isolated network within the Azure cloud platform. It enables secure communication between resources in a virtual network, and also with resources over the internet.

Subnets: Subnets are a logical subdivision of a virtual network. They enable finer-grained network management and security by grouping resources based on their functionality or access requirements.

Network Security Group (NSG): An NSG is a security group that acts as a virtual firewall for a VNet or subnet. It allows or denies traffic based on user-defined rules.

Azure SQL Server: Azure SQL Server is a fully-managed relational database service provided by Microsoft. It offers a variety of deployment options, including single database, elastic pool, and managed instance.

SQL Database: SQL Database is a fully-managed relational database service within Azure that allows you to create, use, and scale databases. It offers a variety of features such as automatic patching, backups, and high availability.

Storage Account: Azure Storage is a cloud storage solution that provides durable, highly available, and scalable storage for data in the cloud.

Container Registry: Azure Container Registry is a private Docker registry service that stores and manages Docker images for your container applications.

Kubernetes Cluster: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes Namespace: Kubernetes namespace is a logical container for a set of Kubernetes resources, and provides an additional level of isolation and management of resources.

These resources are deployed using Terraform templates, which define the configuration of each resource and their interdependencies. By using Terraform, it's possible to create, modify, and delete resources in a consistent, repeatable, and automated way.



Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
This repository contains Terraform code to create and manage infrastructure on Azure cloud. The Terraform files are organized in the following directories:

01-vnet: This directory contains Terraform code to create a virtual network and subnets.
02-aks: This directory contains Terraform code to create an AKS cluster.
03-acr: This directory contains Terraform code to create an Azure Container Registry.
04-app: This directory contains Terraform code to deploy a sample ASP.NET Core application to the AKS cluster.
Prerequisites
Before using the Terraform files, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

An Azure subscription
Azure CLI installed on your local machine
Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) installed on your local machine
Terraform installed on your local machine
Deploying the Infrastructure
To deploy the infrastructure, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Terraform files.

Run the following command to initialize the Terraform workspace:

csharp
Copy code
terraform init
Run the following command to validate the Terraform files:

Copy code
terraform validate
Run the following command to see the changes that will be made to the infrastructure:

Copy code
terraform plan
Run the following command to apply the changes and create the infrastructure:

Copy code
terraform apply
You will be prompted to enter a value for the prefix variable. Enter a unique prefix that will be used to name the resources.

After entering the prefix, Terraform will begin creating the infrastructure. This may take several minutes.

Once the infrastructure has been created, you can run the following command to get the Kubernetes configuration for the AKS cluster:

csharp
Copy code
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name>
Replace <resource-group-name> and <aks-cluster-name> with the names of your resource group and AKS cluster.

Finally, you can run the following command to deploy the sample ASP.NET Core application to the AKS cluster:

Copy code
kubectl apply -f app.yaml
This will create a deployment and service for the application.

Cleaning Up
To delete the infrastructure, run the following command:

Copy code
terraform destroy
This will delete all resources created by Terraform. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion.

Note: This will permanently delete all resources, including the AKS cluster and the sample application. Make sure you have a backup of any data you need before running this command.
